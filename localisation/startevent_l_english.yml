 startevent.1.d:0 "Slacker Squad proudly presents Alternative History: The Kalmar Union, which answers the question: what if the Kalmar Union never broke apart? For months now our team has worked from our little corner in the world to bring this passion project to life. We hope that you will enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it.\n\nNOTE! We have big plans for this mod, and we are now working on an entirely new Alternative History scenario. Where we explore how the world would have been affected and thus The Slacker Squad Development Team is now looking for new developers to add to our little team. We need everything from coders to artists, historians (aka people with some knowledge of history) and story writers. If you have any of these afformentioned talents or any other skills you feel can further contribute to the mod, feel free to contact us at our Discord. (Link in mod description)\n\nEnjoy!"
